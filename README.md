# PureScript Chip8 Emulator

This is something I wrote for fun. Not all games work as I haven't implemented all opcodes. UFO, Blitz & Space Invaders are some of the games that do work.

# TODOs

- [ ] Implement all Opcodes
- [ ] Implement Audio
- [ ] Figure a way to stop emulation when the program exits
